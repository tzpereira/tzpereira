# I'm Mateus Pereira da Silva 👋

👨‍💻 **About Me**

Full Stack Engineer with 4+ years of experience building **scalable, cloud-native systems** and **data-driven applications**.  
I’ve delivered solutions that support **multi-billion-dollar supply chain decisions**, reduced infrastructure footprint, boosted performance, and enabled **self-service analytics** that increased adoption across departments.  

Beyond coding, I work directly with **executives and managers at world-leading supply chain events in Brazil** (a global reference), abstracting complex business challenges into **scalable, reliable, and high-impact systems**.  
Pragmatic and impact-driven, I’m tool-agnostic and choose what best fits each architecture.
